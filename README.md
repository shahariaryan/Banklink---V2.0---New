# Banklink | When banking meets minimalist

A full-fledged banking application. I have implemented the login and sign-up feature as you see in digital banks in reality. Though this banking application doesn't have a database or a server to store the user's data like their username, password, and their account transaction details, I have pre-defined user details like their username, password, and transaction details in an object. You can't create a digital account or sign up right now. As of now I have defined 4 users details. You can log in with their username and password, to see how the application works. Here is the details 👇🏼


## About The Project

### What is Banklink?

Banklink is a fictional online bank. This is a project designed by Jonas Schmedtmann to practice DOM manipulation and user interaction. You can log into the account and use several functions, just like in a real bank!

### Functions:

- Login
- Transferring value to another account
- Get a loan
- Closing (deleting) an account.

## login details

There must be no actual registration behind this! Be sure to use usernames in lowercase!

### Account 1

- Username: fr
- Password: 1111

### Account 2

- Username: sa
- Password: 2222

### Account 3

- Username: stw
- Password: 3333

### Account 4

- Username: ss
- Password: 4444

## Built-in

1. HTML5
2. CSS
3. Vanilla Javascript

## What I learned

I learned a lot about DOM manipulation and user interaction. I was able to practice new things for many parts of me, such as login, date and currency management based on location. I really liked the challenges that came up, both in the implementation of responsiveness and connecting the main page and the login page. I found it interesting how the DOM can be manipulated depending on who is logged in.
